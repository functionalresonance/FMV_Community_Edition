# FMV_Community_Edition
This is the standard version of the FRAM Model Visualiser that is freely available as a Progressive Web App at https://fmv.zerprize.co.nz.

For Instructions and other documentation go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/wiki) on the toolbar above. To contribute to the community, you can raise [Issues](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/issues), request updates to the code with [Pull requests](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/pulls), or join [Discussions](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/discussions).

The basic functionality available unauthorized (without creating a user account or without signing in to the application) is more than adequate for the purpose of learning the FRAM - Functional Resonance Analysis Method, for modelling non-trivial socio-technical systems. More information on FRAM can be found at https://functionalresonance.com/brief-introduction-to-fram/

When a user creates an account and/or logs in to the application then further functionality is unlocked that is equivalent to the functionality provided by the previous free stand-alone versions of the software. This includes the basic FMI - FRAM Model Interpreter, used to check FRAM models for syntactic errors, and to visualise basic instantiations.

Projects forked from this base may explore extended functionality for qualitative and quantitative analyis, model interpretation, simulation and analytics.

The application was developed as a Blazor WebAssembly App using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022, and published as a .NET 8.0 self-contained browser-wasm. If the repository was cloned to Visual Studio and published to a folder structure, the resulting web.config and wwwroot folder could be placed on a web server to run the application. This is exactly the case for the public version on https://fmv.zerprize.co.nz.
